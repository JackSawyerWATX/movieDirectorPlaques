# Famous Movie Directors

This project showcases a collection of 21 of the most famous movie directors from around the world, both alive and deceased. It is an interactive web application designed to highlight key facts about these directors, such as their birthplace, the number of movies they directed, their most famous film, and whether they have won an Oscar.
